# FaceCheckin

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

* Python 3.12 and pip are required for facial recognition. The setup will create a virtual environment and install dependencies from `assets/requirements.txt`.
